== Introduction
I am a software professional and with the popularity of Kubernetes, I now write software
that runs on a Kubernetes platform. Most developers tinker with new technology at home, at
night. And, employers can't afford to train their staff or allow consultants to just learn
on the job. For my situation, Kubernetes is expensive to host in the cloud for personal
and training reasons. I've recently arrived at a better solution and that's my own K8s
cluster using recently available Model 4b Raspberry Pi machines.

I now run 3 clusters continuously, 1 ARM64 and 2 X86-64 or AMD64.
